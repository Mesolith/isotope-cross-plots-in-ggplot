## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## this is a test to try and format a reasonable stable isotope cross plot in r

First load ggplot2
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```


Then generate some dummy data


```{r}
data <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 1:10)    #  dummy data in a frame
```
        
then plot it

```{r}
ggp <- ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +   # Create plot without text
  geom_point()
ggp                      # Draw ggplot
```

Then add some axis labels and a title

```{r}
ggp +                                 
  xlab("d13C VPDB") +  # add x axis label
  ylab("d15N AIR") +   # add y axis label
ggtitle(expression("Test isotope cross plot" ~ delta * beta))

```

OK  but those axis lables are a bit lame no superscriots and no delta symbol...Can we fix this




  these bits are from ericas normalisation script                 
```{r}
#d15N <- expression(paste("Normalized ", delta^{15},"N (\u2030)"))
d13C <- expression(paste("Normalized ", delta^{13},"C (\u2030)"))
d13C
```




we will use those later
